Course Description
------------------

In this Public Service Design Seminar (PSDS), we will design and build products with developmentally disabled students at the Protestant Guild Learning Center in Waltham, MA. We will work closely with community clients to make sure that what you develop is helpful and functional. We will build these products using the Hobby Shop equipment, the water jet machine in particular. Over the course of the seminar, you will learn how to use the water jet machine and associated OMAX® software. You'll also learn the product development process: determining customer needs, concept development, prototyping, design, and manufacturing.

Course Goals
------------

*   To learn and apply the principles of engineering design by working with community partners
*   To experience the value of service to the recipients and the service providers by providing a valuable product by the end of the term
*   To gain a basic understanding of the water jet machine, including OMAX® software, its capabilities, and its appropriate use
*   To work effectively as a design team member

Grading
-------

This is a six-unit, graded seminar: four hours per week will be spent in class and the remaining two hours will be spent working on homework and design projects.

Because much of the work for this seminar will be done during class time, **attendance is essential**. Students who miss a class or PSDS Lecture should contact the instructor to make up the work. Students who miss more than three meetings without written permission from the instructor will fail the course.

Assignments will generally be assigned on a Wednesday, due on the following Monday, and returned on Wednesday. No extensions will be given without prior written permission from the instructor.

This seminar is graded on attendance & in-class participation, assignments & design notebook, and the final project.
