The class will work closely with community clients to make sure that what is developed is helpful and functional. These products will be built using the Hobby Shop equipment, the water jet machine in particular. Over the course of the seminar, this class will teach students how to use the OMAX\u00ae Jet Machining Center commonly called the water jet and associated OMAX\u00ae\u00a0software. The product development process will also be detailed in depth: determining customer needs, concept development, prototyping, design, and manufacturing.\n",
